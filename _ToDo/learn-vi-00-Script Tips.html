	<h2 class="article"><a id="grepprg">Gvim or Vim?</a></h2>
<p>Some scripts have extra features when used in the GUI version of Vim (Gvim). This could be adding menus, toolbars, or other things that only work if you are using Gvim. So what do you do to check if the user runs the script in a console Vim or in Gvim? Vim has already prepared the information for you. You simply have to check if the feature <i>gui_running</i> is enabled. To do so, you use a function called <i>has()</i>, which returns 1 (true) if a given feature is supported / enabled and 0 (false), otherwise.</p>
<p></p>
	<p><code class="inset">
	if has("gui_running")<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"execute gui-only commands here.<br />
	endif</code></p>
<p>This is all you need to do to check if a user has used Gvim or not. Note that it is not enough to check if the feature "gui" exists, because this will return true if your Vim is just compiled with GUI support—even if it is not using it.</p>
<p> <code class="inset">:help feature-list</code>for a complete list of other features you can check with the <i>has()</i> function.</i></p>

	<h2 class="article"><a id="grepprg">Which operating system?</a></h2>
<p>Vim可以判断当前是在何种操作系统之内，以便执行特点的操作</p>
<p><code class="inset">
if has("win16") || has("win32") || has("win64")|| has("win95")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" do windows things here<br/>
elseif has("unix")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" do linux/unix things here
<br />
endif</code></p>
<p>This example only shows how to check for Windows and Linux / Unix. As Vim is available on a wide variety of platforms, you can of course also check for these. All of the operating systems can be found in:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br><b>:help 'feature-list'</b></p></pre>

	<h2 class="article"><a id="grepprg">Which version of Vim?</a></h2>
<p>The number consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major number (for example, 7 for Vim version 7)</li>
<li>Minor number (for example, 3 for Vim version 6.3)</li>
<li>Patch number (for example, 123 for Vim 7.0.123)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two numbers are the actual version number, but when minor features / patches are applied to a version of Vim, it is mostly only the patch number that is increased. It takes quite a bit of change to get the minor number to increase, and a major part of Vim should change in order to increase the major version number.</p>
<p>以下代码用于确定Vim的版本号：</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br>if v:version &gt;= 702 || v:version == 701 &amp;&amp; has("patch123")<br>  " code here is only done for version 7.1 with patch 123<br>  " and version 7.2 and above<br>endif</p></pre>
<p>注意： minor version number 如果小于10，那么需要在以0为前导。如果当前Patch number高于指定的补丁编号（比如124），那么也肯定包含了指定的补丁编号（比如123）。</p>
<h2>Printing longer lines</h2>
<p>Vim was originally created for old text terminals where the length of lines was limited to a certain number of characters. Today, this old limitation shows up once in a while.</p>
<p>One place where you meet this limitation of line length is when printing longer lines to the screen using the "echo" statement. Even though you use Vim in a window where there are more than the traditional 80 characters per line, Vim will still prompt you to press <i>Enter</i> after echoing lines longer than 80 characters. There is, however, a way to get around this, and make it possible to use the entire window width to echo on. Window width means the total number of columns in the Vim window minus a single character. So if your Vim window is wide enough to have 120 characters on each line, then the window width is 120-1 characters.</p>
<p>By adding the following function to your script, you will be able to echo screen-wide long lines in Vim:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br>" WideMsg() prints [long] message up to (&amp;columns-1) length<br>function! WideMsg(msg)<br>  let x=&amp;ruler | let y=&amp;showcmd<br>  set noruler noshowcmd<br>  redraw<br>  echo a:msg<br>  let &amp;ruler=x | let &amp;showcmd=y<br>endfunction</p></pre><p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"><i>This function was originally proposed by the Vim script developer Yakov Lerner on the Vim online community site at <a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_blank">http://www.vim.org</a>.</i></p>
<p>Now whenever you need to echo a long line of text in your script, instead of using the <i>echo</i> statement you simply use the function <i>Widemsg()</i>. An example could be:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:call WideMsg("This should be a very long line of text")</b></p></pre><p>The length of a single line message is still limited, but now it is limited to the width of the Vim window instead of the traditional 80-1 characters.</p>

	<h2 class="article"><a id="grepprg">Debugging Vim scripts</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes things in your scripts do not work exactly as you expect them to. In these cases, it is always good to know how to debug your script.</p>
<p>In Vim, there is a special mode to perform script debugging. Depending on what you want to debug, there are some different ways to start this mode. So let's look at some different cases.</p>
<p>If Vim just throws some errors (by printing them at the bottom of the Vim window), but you are not really sure where it is or why it happens, then you might want to try to start Vim directly in debugging mode. This is done on the command line by invoking Vim with the <i>-D</i>argument.</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>vim -D somefile.txt</b></p></pre><p>The debugging mode is started when Vim starts to read the first <i>vimrc</i> file it loads (in most cases the global <i>vimrc</i> file where Vim is installed). We will look at what to do when you get into debug mode in a moment.</p>
<p>Another case where you might want to get into debug mode is when you already know which function the error (most likely) is in, and hence, just want to debug that function. In that case you just open Vim as normal (load the script with the particular function if needed) and then use the following command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:debug call Myfunction()</b></p></pre><p>Here everything after the <i>:debug</i> is the functionality you want to debug. In this case, it is a simple call of the function <i>Myfunction()</i>, but it could just as well be any of the following:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:debug read somefile.txt<br>:debug nmap ,a :call Myfunction() &lt;CR&gt;<br>:debug help :debug</b></p></pre><p>So let's look at what to do when we get into the debugging mode.</p>
<p>When reaching the first line that it should debug, Vim breaks the loading and shows something like:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;">Entering Debug mode. Type "cont" to continue.<br>cmd: call MyFunction()<br>&gt;</p></pre><p>Now you are in the Vim script debugger and have some choices for what to make Vim do.</p>
<p>The following commands are available in the debugger (shortcuts are in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li><i>cont</i> (<i>c</i>): Continue running the scripts / commands as normal (no debugging) until the next breakpoint (more about this later).</li>
<li><i>quit</i> (<i>q</i>): Quit the debugging process without executing the last lines.</li>
<li><i>interrupt</i> (<i>i</i>): Stop the current process like <i>quit</i>, but go back to the debugger.</li>
<li><i>step</i> (<i>s</i>): Execute the next line of code and come back to the debugger when it is finished. If a line calls a function or sources a file, then it will step into the function / file.</li>
<li><i>next</i> (<i>n</i>): Execute the <i>next</i> command and come back to the debugger when it is finished. If used on a line with a function call, it does not go into the function but steps over it.</li>
<li><i>finish</i> (<i>f</i>): Continue executing the script without stopping on breakpoints. Go into debug mode when done.</li>
</ul>
                        <p>So now you simply execute the different commands to go through the lines of the script / function to see how it jumps through the <i>if</i> conditions, and so on. If you want to execute the same command multiple times, you simply press <i>Enter</i> without feeding a new command.</p>
<p>You can at any point execute another <i>Ex</i> command if needed (see <i>:help 'excommand-index'</i>), but note that you don't have direct access to the variables, among others, in the debugger, unless they are global.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the place you want to get to is many lines into the code, and you really don't want to step all the way through the code until you get to that place.</p>
<p>In that case, you can insert a breakpoint at the exact line where you want to start the real debugging, and then just execute a <i>cont</i> as the first command. A breakpoint is inserted by one of the following commands, depending on how you want it inserted:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br>breakadd func linenum functionname<br>breakadd file linenum filename<br>breakadd here</p></pre>
<p>The first example sets a breakpoint on a particular function. The <i>functionname</i> can be a pattern such as <i>Myfunction*</i> if you, for instance, want to break on any function with a name that begins with <i>Myfunction</i>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is not in a function that the problem resides, but rather around a specific line in a file. If this is the case, then you should use the second command, where you give it a line number and a filename pattern as arguments to tell it where to break.</p>
<p>The final command is used if you have already stepped to the right place in the file but want to be able to break on it the next time you go through the code in the debugger. This command simply sets a breakpoint on the current line, in the current file, where you currently are in the debugger.</p>
<p>You can at any point of time get a list of breakpoints with the following command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:breaklist</b></p></pre>
<p>If a breakpoint is no longer needed, you have to delete it. As when adding breakpoints, there are a few different ways to delete them also.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do it is by simply finding the number of the breakpoint in the list of breakpoints, and then using the following command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br><b>:breakdel number</b></p></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can delete the breakpoints the same way as you added them—except that you now use <i>breakdel</i> instead of <i>breakadd</i>:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:breakdel func linenum functionname<br>:breakdel file linenum file<br>breakdel here</b></p></pre>
<p>If you want to remove all breakpoints, you can do it in one step by using this command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br><b>:breakdel *</b></p></pre>
<p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"><i>You can add a breakpoint directly on the command line when going into debug mode. Simply use the <i>-c</i> argument as follows:</i></p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>vim -D -c 'breakadd file 15 */.vimrc' somefile.txt</b></p></pre>

	<h2 class="article"><a id="grepprg">Distributing Vim scripts</a></h2>
<p>Now that your script is ready, it is time for you to distribute the script. </p>
<p>First of all, you need to figure out whether your script needs to be packed into a compressed file such as a ZIP file, or if it should just be distributed as a single <i>.vim</i> file. The main reason for choosing the first option is that your script consists of multiple files (such as main script, file type plugin, syntax file, documentation, and so on).</p>
<p>How to create ZIP files (or related file types) is beyond what this article will look at, but here are a couple of pointers on how I make my ZIP files "install ready":</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the ZIP file including the folders where the files are placed relative to your <i>VIMHOME</i>. For example, consider that you have:
<p><i>VIMHOME/plugin/myscript.vim</i></p>
<p><i>VIMHOME/syntax/mylang.vim</i></p>
<p><i>VIMHOME/doc/myscript.txt</i></p>
<p>Then the ZIP file should contain the three folders: <i>plugin</i>, <i>syntax</i>, and <i>doc</i> with one file in each. This makes the installation easy, as you simply have to go into your <i>VIMHOME</i> and then unpack the ZIP file.</p>
</li>
<li>Always include a help file for your script. This file should be installed in <i>VIMHOME/doc/</i> and contain descriptions of what the script does, which settings it has, and how to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though you only have one script file, it can still be a good idea to put it in a ZIP file together with a help file. This makes it easier for you to remember to add documentation. We will look more at how to create Vim documentation in the next section.</p>
<h2>Making Vimballs</h2>
<p>Another alternative is to make a Vimball. </p>
<p>The command to create a Vimball is constructed as:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br><b>:[range]MkVimball filename.vba</b></p></pre>
<p></p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is to open a new empty buffer in Vim with:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:enew</b></p></pre>
<p>Now you add the paths to all the files (one on each line) relative to your <i>VIMHOME</i>. Considering the previous ZIP file example, it could look like:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><br>plugin/myscript.vim<br>doc/myscript.txt<br>syntax/mylang.vim</p></pre>
<p>When this is done you are actually ready to execute the command across the range of lines. Place the cursor on the first line in the buffer, go into normal mode, and use the keys <i>Shift+v</i> to select all the lines with paths on. Now all you have to do is execute the command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><p style="white-space: pre;"><b>:MkVimball myscript.vba</b></p></pre>
<p>Vim will automatically add the range of the lines you have selected in front of the command. The filename <i>myscript.vba</i> can be any name, but if the file already exists, then a warning is given, but no file is written.</p>
<p>If you really want to overwrite an existing file, then just add an ! after the <i>MkVimball</i> command to tell Vim that you mean it. There is no more to it. You now have a Vimball file called <i>myscript.vba</i>, which can be installed as described earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"><i>Remember that you need to install the Vimball script in order to use the Vimball functions we have described at. The latest version of the Vimball script can always be found here: <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502" target="_blank">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502</a>.</i></p>
